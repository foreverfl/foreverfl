## About Me
Hello! I'm a full-stack engineer with a keen interest in both backend and frontend development, as well as infrastructure.

My skills also include basic data analysis, and I am capable of using pre-built AI models from platforms such as Hugging Face and YOLO.

I'm passionate about creating web and app applications that have a positive impact on humanity and bring joy to people.
