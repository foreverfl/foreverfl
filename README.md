## About Me
Hello! I'm a full-stack engineer with expertise in both backend and frontend development, as well as infrastructure management.  
My technical skillset also includes fundamental data analysis, and I am experienced in utilizing pre-built AI models from platforms like Hugging Face and YOLO to create innovative solutions.

I am deeply passionate about developing web and mobile applications that bring value to humanity and enhance user experiences. Looking forward, my ultimate goal is to contribute to the evolution of the internet by implementing Web3 through blockchain technology, creating decentralized solutions that empower individuals and communities.

Let's build a better, more open internet together!
